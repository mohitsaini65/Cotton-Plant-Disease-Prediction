# Cotton Plant Disease Prediction 🌱

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting cotton plant diseases using deep learning techniques.
An image-based classification system was developed to identify healthy and diseased cotton plants.

## Dataset
- Cotton leaf and plant images
- Multiple disease classes along with healthy class
- Dataset used strictly for academic purposes

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Transfer Learning using InceptionV3
- Performance comparison across CNN architectures

## Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy
- InceptionV3 provided the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset to Google Drive
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Future Improvements
- Mobile application deployment
- Real-time disease detection system
